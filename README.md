Welcome to Frigate!
How large should I make the grid? 2
The minimum grid size is 5... I'll create one that size.

         A B C D E
       +----------
    1  | - - - - -
    2  | - - - - -
    3  | - - - - -
    4  | - - - - -
    5  | - - - - -

    Enter the coordinate for your shot (3 shots remaining): 4b

    B4 is a miss

         A B C D E
       +----------
    1  | - m - - -
    2  | c h h h h
    3  | - h - m -
    4  | - m m - -
    5  | m h h h b

    You do not have enough shells left to sink the remaining ships.
    Here is the original ship locations.

        A B C D E
       +----------
    1  | - - f f -
    2  | c c c c c
    3  | - f f - -
    4  | - - - - -
    5  | - b b b b

    You sunk two ships.
